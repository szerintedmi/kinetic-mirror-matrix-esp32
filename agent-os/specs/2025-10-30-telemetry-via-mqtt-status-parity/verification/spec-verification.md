# Specification Verification Report

## Verification Summary
- Overall Status: ✅ Passed
- Date: 2025-10-30
- Spec: telemetry-via-mqtt-status-parity
- Reusability Check: ✅ Passed
- Test Writing Limits: ✅ Compliant

## Structural Verification (Checks 1-2)

### Check 1: Requirements Accuracy
- ✅ All user answers accurately captured in `planning/requirements.md`
- ✅ Follow-up clarifications documented, including the aggregate-topic update and removal of `msg_id`
- ✅ No reusability references were provided by the user (documented as none)

### Check 2: Visual Assets
- ✅ No visual assets found in `planning/visuals/`

## Content Validation (Checks 3-7)

### Check 3: Visual Design Tracking
- Not applicable (no visual assets)

### Check 4: Requirements Coverage
**Explicit Features Requested:**
- Aggregate MQTT status snapshot on `devices/<id>/status` at 1 Hz idle / 5 Hz motion — ✅ Covered in spec.md and tasks.md
- Change-triggered publishes beyond keepalive cadence — ✅ Covered
- Structured JSON parity with serial `STATUS`, no `msg_id` — ✅ Covered
- Replace legacy retained presence topic with aggregate snapshot + Last Will — ✅ Covered
- Commands over MQTT remain out of scope — ✅ Marked in spec and tasks

**Constraints / Non-Functional Requirements:**
- QoS0, non-retained live publishes with Last Will handling — ✅ Covered
- Resource budget awareness (no heap churn, fast assembly) — ✅ Covered

**Out-of-Scope Items:**
- MQTT command processing — ✅ Explicitly excluded
- Per-motor topics or additional metadata — ✅ Explicitly excluded

**Reusability Opportunities:**
- None provided; spec/tasks leverage existing presence client and CLI infrastructure appropriately

### Check 5: Core Specification Validation
- Goal alignment: ✅ Matches the updated aggregate telemetry objective
- User stories: ✅ All reflect stakeholder needs discussed during Q&A
- Core requirements: ✅ Align with requirements summary and later clarifications
- Out of scope: ✅ Matches requirements (commands, per-motor topics left out)
- Reusability notes: ✅ References existing `MqttPresenceClient`, controller state, and CLI MQTT runtime

### Check 6: Task List Issues
- Test writing limits: ✅ Task Group 3 caps new tests at six and limits execution to feature-specific suites; other groups focus on implementation/bench work without overextending testing scope
- Reusability references: ✅ Tasks explicitly extend existing MQTT client/publisher infrastructure and CLI runtime
- Specificity & Traceability: ✅ Each task references concrete modules/files and maps directly to spec requirements
- Visual references: ✅ Not applicable (no visuals)
- Task counts per group: ✅ Between 4–6 actionable items per group

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check
- ✅ Aggregate publisher reuses existing AsyncMqtt client; no duplicate connections introduced
- ✅ Host tooling updates build on current MQTT runtime instead of creating new tools
- ✅ UUID generator retained for future roadmap use, avoiding rework later
- ✅ No unnecessary components identified

## Conclusion
Specification and task list align with the finalized requirements, reuse existing infrastructure appropriately, and respect the focused testing strategy. Ready for implementation.
