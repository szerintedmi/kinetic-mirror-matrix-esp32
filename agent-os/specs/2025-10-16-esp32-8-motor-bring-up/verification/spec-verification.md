# Specification Verification Report

## Verification Summary

- Overall Status: ✅ Passed
- Date: 2025-10-16
- Spec: 2025-10-16-esp32-8-motor-bring-up
- Reusability Check: ✅ Passed
- Test Writing Limits: ✅ Compliant

## Structural Verification (Checks 1-2)

### Check 1: Requirements Accuracy

All decisions from requirements are reflected in the spec:

- Hardware SPI (VSPI) to two 74HC595 for DIR/SLEEP
- SLEEP pin is controlled (nENBL tied LOW); WAKE/SLEEP are diagnostic overrides; auto-sleep via FastAccelStepper
- DIR latched at motion start only; overlapping MOVE rejected (BUSY)
- Full-step only (MS1..MS3=000)
- Concurrency allowed; ensure shift+latched before motion
- Defaults: speed=4000, accel=16000
- STATUS minimal
✅ All user answers accurately captured
✅ Reusability opportunities documented (reuse protocol + MotorBackend abstraction)

### Check 2: Visual Assets

No visual files provided.
✅ Nothing to verify against visuals

## Content Validation (Checks 3-7)

### Check 3: Visual Design Tracking

No visuals exist for this spec; not applicable.

### Check 4: Requirements Coverage

Explicit features requested:

- VSPI to 74HC595 (DIR/SLEEP) — ✅ Covered in spec
- Use SLEEP (not ENABLE), nENBL tied LOW — ✅ Covered
- FastAccelStepper with auto-sleep; WAKE/SLEEP diagnostic — ✅ Covered
- DIR latch at start; reject overlapping MOVE — ✅ Covered
- Full-step only — ✅ Covered
- Concurrency; latch before motion — ✅ Covered
- Defaults speed/accel — ✅ Covered
- STATUS minimal — ✅ Covered

Out-of-Scope Items:

- Microstepping, telemetry/fault detail — ✅ Correctly excluded
- Exact cross-motor sync — ✅ Correctly excluded

### Check 5: Core Specification Issues

- Goal alignment: ✅ Matches bring-up objective
- User stories: ✅ Relevant to requirements (concurrent moves, unchanged protocol)
- Core requirements: ✅ Only features from requirements
- Out of scope: ✅ Matches requirements
- Reusability notes: ✅ Mentions MotorBackend reuse and protocol compatibility

### Check 6: Task List Detailed Validation

- Test Writing Limits: ✅ Each task group specifies 2–8 focused tests max (targets of 4–6)
- Reusability References: ✅ HardwareBackend integrates via existing MotorBackend; SPI driver reusable via clean API
- Specificity: ✅ Concrete pins, SPI lines, byte layouts, and APIs are specified
- Traceability: ✅ Tasks map directly to spec requirements (SPI driver → DIR/SLEEP packing; backend → latch-before-start, BUSY, FAS calls)
- Scope: ✅ No tasks outside requirements
- Visual references: ✅ Not applicable (no visuals)
- Task count: ✅ Groups within 3–10 tasks

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check

- Unnecessary new components: ✅ None; HardwareBackend is required for bring-up
- Duplicated logic: ✅ None; SPI driver encapsulated once and reused
- Missing reuse: ✅ Reuses MotorBackend abstraction; protocol unchanged
- Justification for new code: ✅ SPI driver + backend necessary for hardware control

## Result

Specification verification complete.
All specifications accurately reflect requirements, follow limited testing approach, and properly leverage existing code abstractions.
