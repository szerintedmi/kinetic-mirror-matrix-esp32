# Specification Verification Report

## Verification Summary
- Overall Status: ✅ Passed
- Date: 2025-10-29
- Spec: MQTT Steel Thread: Presence
- Reusability Check: ✅ Passed
- Test Writing Limits: ✅ Compliant

## Structural Verification (Checks 1-2)

### Check 1: Requirements Accuracy
- ✅ All user answers and follow-ups are accurately captured in `planning/requirements.md`
- ✅ Reusability opportunities (`include/secrets.h`, CID generator) are documented

### Check 2: Visual Assets
- ✅ No visual assets present in `planning/visuals/`

## Content Validation (Checks 3-7)

### Check 3: Visual Design Tracking
- Not applicable (no visual assets provided)

### Check 4: Requirements Coverage
**Explicit Features Requested:**
- MQTT presence using existing Wi-Fi and secrets defaults: ✅ Covered in spec Functional Requirements and tasks 1.0/1.5
- Birth payload with IP and retained LWT offline: ✅ Spec Functional Requirements and tasks 1.0–1.2
- MAC-based topic naming: ✅ Spec Functional Requirements and task 1.1
- No aggressive reconnect; log once: ✅ Spec Functional Requirements and task 1.2
- CLI/TUI MQTT presence transport option: ✅ Spec Functional Requirements and tasks 2.0–2.4
- UUID-based `msg_id` + serial parity: ✅ Spec Functional Requirements and tasks 1.3–1.4
- Deferred broker credential SET/GET follow-up: ✅ Spec Technical Approach / Out of Scope and tasks 1.5, 4.0–4.2

**Constraints / Performance:**
- Latency targets (<25 ms median / <100 ms p95): ✅ Spec Non-Functional Requirements and task 3.2
- Resource budgets (<15 kB flash, <4 kB RAM): ✅ Spec Non-Functional Requirements
- Plaintext MQTT only: ✅ Spec Non-Functional Requirements and Out of Scope

**Out-of-Scope Items:**
- Runtime credential commands: ✅ Out of Scope & deferred task group
- MQTT command/status parity beyond presence: ✅ Out of Scope
- TLS/cloud brokers: ✅ Out of Scope

**Reusability Opportunities:**
- Command pipeline, NetOnboarding, CLI runtime, secrets defaults, CID generator explicitly referenced in spec and tasks.

### Check 5: Core Specification Validation
- Goal aligns with roadmap intent and requirements: ✅
- User stories trace back to gathered needs: ✅
- Core requirements limited to requested capabilities: ✅
- Out of scope matches user exclusions: ✅
- Reusability notes reflect documented opportunities: ✅

### Check 6: Task List Detailed Validation
**Test Writing Limits:**
- ✅ Task Group 1 (Firmware) adds Task 1.6 specifying 2-4 focused tests and to run only those tests.
- ✅ Task Group 2 (CLI/TUI) adds Task 2.4 specifying 2-4 focused tests and limited execution.
- ✅ Task Group 3 caps total new tests at ≤10 and restricts execution to tests from 3.0–3.1.
- ✅ No group requests full-suite runs or exhaustive coverage.

**Reusability References:**
- ✅ Tasks reference existing systems (NetOnboarding, command pipeline, CLI runtime).

**Specificity & Traceability:**
- ✅ Each task maps to explicit spec requirements and user inputs.

**Visual References:**
- Not applicable (no visuals).

**Task Count:**
- ✅ Task groups contain 3–7 tasks each (Deferred Follow-up now has 3 tasks).

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering
- ✅ No redundant components introduced; new modules justified by missing MQTT layer.
- ✅ Logic reuse maximized; no duplicated functionality detected.
- ✅ Deferred follow-up keeps future credential work scoped separately.

## Critical Issues
- None.

## Minor Issues
- None.

## Over-Engineering Concerns
- None identified.

## Recommendations
- Proceed to implementation; maintain focused testing limits during execution.

## Conclusion
All specifications and tasks reflect user requirements, uphold reuse guidance, and comply with the limited-testing standards. Ready for implementation.
