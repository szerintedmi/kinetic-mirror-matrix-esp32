We're continuing our implementation of Status & Diagnostics by implementing task group number 3:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

### Formatting & Build Validation

#### Task Group 3: HELP/STATUS format updates and build
Assigned implementer: api-engineer
Dependencies: Task Group 1
Standards: `@agent-os/standards/testing/build-validation.md`, `@agent-os/standards/global/platformio-project-setup.md`

- [ ] 3.0 Finalize formats and validate builds
  - [ ] 3.1 Update/extend existing HELP/STATUS tests
    - Verify new keys appear in STATUS first line; maintain valid HELP
    - Target 3â€“4 assertions within existing test file
  - [ ] 3.2 Build validation
    - Compile firmware for `esp32dev` via PlatformIO
  - [ ] 3.3 Confirm serial output length remains manageable (no flooding)

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-17-status-diagnostics/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with areas of specialization (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- The existing patterns that you've found and analyzed.
- User Standards & Preferences which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- Build validation via PlatformIO for `esp32dev`.

## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.

## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `[task-number]-[task-title]-implementation.md`.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

IMPORTANT: Ensure that your implementation work is ALIGNED and DOES NOT CONFLICT with the user's preferences and standards as detailed in the following files:

@agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md
@agent-os/standards/global/platformio-project-setup.md
@agent-os/standards/testing/build-validation.md
@agent-os/standards/frontend/serial-interface.md
