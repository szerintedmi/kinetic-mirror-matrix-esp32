We're continuing our implementation of Command Pipeline Modularization by implementing task group number 3:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

#### Task Group 3: Test Gap Review & Regression Audit
**Assigned implementer:** testing-engineer
**Dependencies:** Task Groups 1-2

- [ ] 3.0 Validate coverage and regression safety
  - [ ] 3.1 Review tests from Task Groups 1 and 2 to map covered scenarios
  - [ ] 3.2 Identify any remaining high-risk behaviors (e.g., CID reuse in nested batches, NET command fallbacks) lacking targeted tests
  - [ ] 3.3 Add up to 6 additional regression-focused tests covering uncovered critical paths (reuse existing harnesses; no new frameworks)
  - [ ] 3.4 Run ONLY the combined feature-specific tests (from 1.1, 2.1, and 3.3)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Added tests address critical uncovered behaviors without exceeding limits
- All feature-specific tests pass
- Report confirms existing command semantics preserved (formatting, warnings, BUSY handling)

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-29-command-pipeline-modularization/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.


## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.


## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `3-test-gap-review-regression-audit-implementation.md`.

Use the implementation report template provided in the Task Group 1 prompt. Ensure you document:
- Summary of regression analysis and additional tests added
- File paths for any test updates
- Compliance with relevant standards files listed below

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

IMPORTANT: Ensure that your implementation work is ALIGNED and DOES NOT CONFLICT with the user's preferences and standards as detailed in the following files:

@agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md
@agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md
