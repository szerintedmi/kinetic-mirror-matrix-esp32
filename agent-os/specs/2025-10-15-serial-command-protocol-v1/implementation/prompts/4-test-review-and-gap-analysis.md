We're continuing our implementation of Serial Command Protocol v1 by implementing task group number 4:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

#### Task Group 4: Test Review & Gap Analysis
Assigned implementer: testing-engineer
Dependencies: Task Groups 1–3
Standards: `@agent-os/standards/testing/unit-testing.md`, `@agent-os/standards/testing/hardware-validation.md`

- [ ] 4.0 Review feature tests and fill critical gaps only
  - [ ] 4.1 Review tests from Task Groups 1–3 (expected 14 tests)
  - [ ] 4.2 Analyze coverage gaps specific to this spec
    - Focus on: busy handling across ALL targets, out‑of‑range rejection, HOME parameter parsing without clamping
  - [ ] 4.3 Write up to 10 additional strategic tests maximum
    - Prioritize end‑to‑end protocol flows through the parser and handlers
  - [ ] 4.4 Run feature‑specific tests only
    - Run ONLY tests from 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, and 4.3 (expected total 16–24)

Acceptance Criteria:
- All feature-specific tests pass (≤ 24 total)
- Critical flows covered (busy, ALL, POS_OUT_OF_RANGE, HELP/STATUS formatting)
- No more than 10 additional tests added

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-15-serial-command-protocol-v1/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with areas of specialization (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- The existing patterns that you've found and analyzed.
- User Standards & Preferences which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.

## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.

## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `[task-number]-[task-title]-implementation.md`.

Use the documentation template described in the implement-spec command to record what you changed and why.
