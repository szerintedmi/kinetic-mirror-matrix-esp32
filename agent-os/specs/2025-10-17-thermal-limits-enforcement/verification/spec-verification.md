# Specification Verification Report

## Verification Summary
- Overall Status: ⚠️ Issues Found
- Date: 2025-10-18
- Spec: 2025-10-17-thermal-limits-enforcement
- Reusability Check: ✅ Passed
- Test Writing Limits: ✅ Compliant

## Structural Verification (Checks 1-2)

### Check 1: Requirements Accuracy
- Requirements file present: yes
- Spec file present: yes
- Tasks file present: yes
- Summary:
  - User’s Q&A captured and aligned (budget_s/ttfc_s, compile-time constants, pre-checks, WAKE behavior, WARN when OFF).
  - Global flag exposure updated to GET/SET in requirements.

### Check 2: Visual Assets
- Visuals present: no
No visual files found

## Content Validation (Checks 3-7)

### Check 3: Visual Design Tracking
No visuals provided; N/A.

### Check 4: Requirements Coverage
- Explicit features requested:
  - Per-motor time-based limits with budget_s/ttfc_s: ✅ Covered
  - Compile-time thresholds only, no persistence: ✅ Covered
  - MOVE/HOME pre-checks with deterministic estimator: ✅ Covered
  - WAKE auto-shutdown after grace overrun: ✅ Covered
  - Global ON/OFF with WARN when OFF: ✅ Covered
  - CLI shows global flag: ✅ Covered (via GET)
- Constraints stated: no speed throttling; integer-friendly math; clear errors: ✅ Reflected
- Out-of-scope: runtime tuning/persistence/per-motor overrides: ✅ Listed
- Reusability: reuse STATUS metrics and command parsing; add shared MotionKinematics: ✅ Present

### Check 5: Core Specification Validation
- Goal alignment: ✅ Matches requirements
- User stories: ✅ Relevant
- Core requirements: ✅ Derived from requirements
- Out of scope: ✅ Matches requirements
- Reusability notes: ✅ Present
- Noted Issue(s):
- Spec still references STATUS summary line in places.\n

### Check 6: Task List Issues
- Test writing limits: ✅ Focused unit tests per group; no excessive counts
- Reusability references: ✅ Uses shared estimator; existing parsing
- Specificity/Traceability: ✅ Tasks map to spec (GET/SET, estimator, pre-checks, runtime enforcement, CLI WARN surfacing)
- Visual alignment: N/A
- Task count per group: ✅ Within expected bounds

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check
- Unnecessary new components: ❌ None observed (shared helper justified)
- Duplicated logic: ❌ None (single MotionKinematics source)
- Missing reuse opportunities: ❌ None apparent
- Justification for new code: ✅ Clear

## Recommendations
- Remove any residual mention of a STATUS summary line from spec Functional Requirements to avoid client-side special casing.
- Keep GET/SET as the authoritative interface for the global flag; STATUS remains per-motor only.

## Conclusion
The spec and tasks are largely aligned with requirements and standards. Minor cleanup noted above. Ready to proceed to implementation once the small spec wording tweak is applied.
