We're continuing our implementation of Command Pipeline Modularization by implementing task group number 1:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

#### Task Group 1: Command Pipeline Architecture
**Assigned implementer:** api-engineer
**Dependencies:** None

- [ ] 1.0 Establish modular command pipeline
  - [ ] 1.1 Write 3-5 focused unit tests covering parser edge cases (quoted CSV, alias handling, batch conflict detection)
  - [ ] 1.2 Introduce `CommandExecutionContext` encapsulating controller access, CID allocation, and minimal clock/net helpers
  - [ ] 1.3 Extract parsing/validation helpers into a reusable `command_utils` module
  - [ ] 1.4 Implement `CommandParser`, `ParsedCommand`, and `BatchExecutor` preserving current batch semantics
  - [ ] 1.5 Implement `CommandRouter` and handler classes (`MotorCommandHandler`, `QueryCommandHandler`, `NetCommandHandler`) using the shared context
  - [ ] 1.6 Introduce `CommandResult` and response formatter that renders identical serial output (including CID reuse and warnings)
  - [ ] 1.7 Replace legacy monolithic flow with new façade (retaining public entry point) and ensure all existing unit tests pass by running ONLY the new tests from 1.1 plus pre-existing suites touching the command processor

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- New abstractions compile and integrate without altering observable command behavior
- New targeted tests from 1.1 pass alongside existing command processor tests
- Serial responses (single and batched) match prior formatting and CID sequencing

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-29-command-pipeline-modularization/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.


## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.


## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `1-command-pipeline-architecture-implementation.md`.

For example, if you've been assigned implement the 3rd task from `tasks.md` and that task's title is "Commenting System", then you must create the file: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-29-command-pipeline-modularization/implementation/3-commenting-system-implementation.md`.

Use the following structure for the content of your implementation documentation:

```markdown
