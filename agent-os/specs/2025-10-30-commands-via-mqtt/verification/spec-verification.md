# Spec Verification Report — Commands via MQTT (2025-10-30)

## Summary
- Requirements accuracy check: **pass**
- Visual assets check: **n/a (none provided)**
- Specification alignment: **pass with minor note**
- Tasks alignment & limited testing: **pass**
- Reusability coverage: **pass**
- Issues found: 0 critical, 1 minor

## Detailed Findings

### Requirements vs. Research
- All eight Q&A responses in `planning/requirements.md` match the raw answers, including JSON schema consolidation, dual ACK/completion messaging, QoS1 usage, BUSY semantics, transport parity, error-code refactor freedom, staged config commands, and full serial parity.
- Scope boundaries and follow-on MQTT config task are captured exactly as requested.
- Reusability section correctly notes none identified.

### Visual Assets
- `planning/visuals/` contains no files; requirements and spec make no visual references, consistent with the absence of assets.

### Specification Review (`spec.md`)
- Functional and non-functional requirements reflect the research, including single-action MQTT payloads, ack/finish behavior, duplicate suppression, and post-parity config commands.
- Reusable components list existing modules to leverage (MotorCommandProcessor, MessageId, MQTT presence/status clients, CLI workers).
- Out-of-scope items align with requirements (no BUSY changes, no QoS2, no multi-node/master work).
- **Minor note:** Non-functional bullet "Host tooling must survive broker disconnects by retrying publishes, replaying pending commands where QoS requires" could be interpreted as manual retries. User guidance favored immediate rejection when publish fails. Recommend clarifying that host relies on MQTT QoS1 retries rather than bespoke replays.

### Tasks Review (`tasks.md`)
- Four task groups map cleanly to firmware core, config commands, CLI/TUI work, and verification.
- Test-writing guidance stays within 2–8 cases per implementation group and ≤6 additions for the testing engineer; execution steps explicitly restrict runs to feature-specific tests.
- Tasks reference reuse points (shared message ID utility, existing MotorCommandProcessor, MQTT worker) and the new schema document.
- Dependencies follow logical order (core parity → config → tooling → validation).

### Test Strategy & Counts
- Implementation groups define focused PlatformIO/Python test batches without expanding to full suites.
- Testing group limited to at most six new cases, staying under the 10-test ceiling.

## Issues & Recommendations
- **Minor Issue:** Clarify the host-tooling non-functional requirement to avoid implying custom retry loops; align wording with user expectation (surface immediate failure, rely on MQTT QoS1 for retransmit).

## Conclusion
Ready for implementation once the minor wording clarification is addressed (optional but recommended). No blockers found.
