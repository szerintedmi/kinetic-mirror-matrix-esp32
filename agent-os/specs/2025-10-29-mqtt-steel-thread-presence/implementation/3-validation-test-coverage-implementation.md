# Task 3: Validation & Test Coverage (Progress Update)

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #3 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-29-mqtt-steel-thread-presence/tasks.md`  
**Implemented By:** testing-engineer  
**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** ⚠️ Partial

### Task Description
Tighten host-side coverage for the MQTT presence steel thread by validating UUID generation paths, ensuring STATUS commands surface unique `msg_id` values, and keeping the native test suite regression-free while the remaining integration/bench validation work continues.

## Implementation Summary
Hardened the shared UUID generator (`net_onboarding::NextMsgId`) to guarantee consecutive IDs never repeat, even when deterministic test hooks attempt to recycle a value. Added a lightweight Unity suite under `test/test_common` that exercises the STATUS flow end-to-end through `MotorCommandProcessor`, preventing regressions where ACK lines reuse the same `msg_id`. Updated `test_execute_cid_increments` to rely on the shared helper and executed the full native suite to confirm all host-side tests—including the newly added regression—pass cleanly.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
- `test/test_common/test_msgid.cpp` — Host-side regression test verifying consecutive STATUS commands emit distinct UUID-backed ACK lines.

### Modified Files
- `lib/net_onboarding/src/MessageId.cpp` — Ensures the UUID generator skips duplicates by comparing against the active and last-issued IDs.
- `test/test_MotorControl/test_CommandPipeline.cpp` — Simplifies `test_execute_cid_increments` to reuse the generator hooks and assert against duplicate STATUS responses.

### Deleted Files
- _None_

## Testing

### Commands Executed
- `pio test -e native -f test_MotorControl -vv --filter test_execute_cid_increments`
- `pio test -e native`

### Results
- All native suites now pass (106/106 test cases). The dedicated regression passes independently.

## Outstanding Work
- Task 3.1 (host-level MQTT integration harness) and Task 3.2 (bench latency validation) remain pending and will be addressed in subsequent iterations.
