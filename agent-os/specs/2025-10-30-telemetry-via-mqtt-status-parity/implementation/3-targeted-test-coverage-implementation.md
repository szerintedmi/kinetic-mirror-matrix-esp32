# Task 3: Targeted Test Coverage

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #3 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-30-telemetry-via-mqtt-status-parity/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** testing-engineer
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Extend native unit tests to cover aggregate payload serialization, cadence transitions, change suppression, and host-side ingestion of MQTT status snapshots. Run the new suites (plus related ones) and capture latency/cadence evidence.

## Implementation Summary
Added dedicated unit tests for the new `MqttStatusPublisher` covering JSON structure, cadence enforcement, and change-driven publishes. Updated existing presence tests to the new payload schema. On the host side, introduced Python unit tests that feed sample aggregate payloads into `MqttWorker` and verify row rendering parity. Executed the native and Python suites locally; bench latency measurements remain pending due to unavailable hardware.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
- `test/test_MqttStatus/test_MqttStatusPublisher.cpp` - Native tests validating serialization, cadence throttling, and change detection for the status publisher.
- `tools/serial_cli/tests/test_mqtt_runtime.py` - Python unit tests covering aggregate snapshot ingestion and table rendering order.

### Modified Files
- `test/test_MqttPresence/test_MqttPresenceClient.cpp` - Updated expectations for the new status payload and motion-triggered republish behavior.

### Deleted Files
- _None_

## Key Implementation Details

### Native Status Publisher Tests
**Location:** `test/test_MqttStatus/test_MqttStatusPublisher.cpp`

Introduced a `StubController` harness to feed deterministic motor states into the publisher. Tests assert payload fields, single inclusion of `actual_ms`, and cadence behavior across idle/motion regimes with change-triggered publishes.

**Rationale:** Provides regression coverage for serialization parity and cadence guarantees without hardware.

### Host MQTT Worker Tests
**Location:** `tools/serial_cli/tests/test_mqtt_runtime.py`

Verifies that ingesting aggregate snapshots produces STATUS-shaped rows, handles optional fields, and maintains deterministic ordering across multiple devices. Also exercises `render_table` to ensure CLI output stays in sync.

**Rationale:** Protects the CLI/TUI data path from schema regressions and ordering bugs.

## Database Changes (if applicable)

_Not applicable._

## Dependencies (if applicable)

_No new dependencies were required; tests rely on existing Unity and stdlib tooling._

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `test/test_MqttStatus/test_MqttStatusPublisher.cpp`
- `test/test_MqttPresence/test_MqttPresenceClient.cpp`
- `tools/serial_cli/tests/test_mqtt_runtime.py`

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete (native + Python suites added)
- Integration tests: ❌ None
- Edge cases covered: STATUS parity checks, motion/idle cadence enforcement, change suppression, optional `actual_ms` handling, multi-device ordering.

### Manual Testing Performed
- Automated Runs:
  - `pio test -e native --filter test_MqttStatus`
  - `pio test -e native --filter test_MqttPresence`
  - `python -m unittest discover -s tools/serial_cli/tests`
- Hardware cadence/latency capture (Task 3.3) is still outstanding; run on a bench setup with Mosquitto when hardware access becomes available.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### testing/unit-testing.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/testing/unit-testing.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** Added fast, host-executable tests with explicit assertions, keeping runtimes under the 2-second guideline.

**Deviations (if any):** None.

### testing/build-validation.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/testing/build-validation.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** Executed native tests after completing implementation to ensure the codebase builds and new suites pass.

### testing/hardware-validation.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/testing/hardware-validation.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** Documented the outstanding hardware cadence validation so lab operators can execute it when bench access is available.
