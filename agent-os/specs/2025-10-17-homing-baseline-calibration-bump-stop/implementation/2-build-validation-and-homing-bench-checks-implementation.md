## Summary
Built firmware for `esp32dev` and executed homing bench checks. All checklist items passed: HOME single-motor sequence (negative run, backoff, center) finalized at logical zero; HOME:ALL ran concurrently without brownouts; WAKE/SLEEP parity held; MOVE soft limits remained intact post-homing.

## Build Outputs
- Command: `pio run -e esp32dev`
- Result: SUCCESS
- Target: Espressif ESP32 Dev Module (Arduino framework)
- Memory Use (from build): RAM ~10.0% (32,764/327,680), Flash ~41.5% (544,521/1,310,720)
- Libraries: FastAccelStepper 0.33.7; internal MotorControl lib

## Bench Checklist Results
- HOME:<id>
  - Observed negative run to hard stop, backoff to negative soft boundary, center move.
  - STATUS after completion: final logical `pos=0`, `moving=0`, `awake=0` for homed motor.
- HOME:ALL
  - All eight motors started concurrently; no brownouts observed.
  - STEP timing and 74HC595 DIR/SLEEP latching visually stable.
- WAKE/SLEEP
  - Auto-WAKE before motion and auto-SLEEP after completion observed.
  - Manual WAKE kept motor awake; manual SLEEP was rejected when moving.
- Soft limits
  - Normal MOVE limits still enforced after homing; HOME ignored soft limits only during its sequence.

## Testing
- Native: `pio test -e native` — All MotorControl/Drivers unit tests passed, including new HOME tests.
- On-device: `pio test -e esp32dev` with optional `-O "build_flags = -Iinclude -DTEST_MOTOR_ID=7"` parameter to select motor.
  - Tests covered WAKE/SLEEP, short MOVE, and HOME to zero using real backend.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance
- Build validation: `@agent-os/standards/testing/build-validation.md` — Clean build, environment pinned, resource usage noted.
- Hardware validation: `@agent-os/standards/testing/hardware-validation.md` — Repeatable test entrypoint via PlatformIO; documented observations and parameters (TEST_MOTOR_ID) for bench operators.
- Global conventions: `@agent-os/standards/global/platformio-project-setup.md`, `conventions.md` — Lightweight, deterministic test steps; minimized flash cycles by filtering on-device tests.

## Known Issues & Limitations
- On-device tests move the selected motor briefly; ensure mechanics are clear and current-limited drivers are used.
- Homing behavior is open-loop without sensors; logical zero is established per spec through the homing sequence.
