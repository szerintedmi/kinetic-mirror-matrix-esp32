We're continuing our implementation of Command Pipeline Modularization by implementing task group number 2:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

#### Task Group 2: Transport Adapter Preparation
**Assigned implementer:** api-engineer
**Dependencies:** Task Group 1

- [ ] 2.0 Adapt transports to the modular pipeline
  - [ ] 2.1 Write 2-4 focused adapter tests (e.g., ensure serial fa√ßade returns identical strings, structured payload round-trips)
  - [ ] 2.2 Ensure serial command entry point delegates to the new pipeline without behavioral regressions
  - [ ] 2.3 Document integration points for future transports (comments/readme snippets), clarifying expected use of `CommandResult`
  - [ ] 2.4 Run ONLY the tests authored in 2.1 to verify adapter behavior

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Serial adapter uses the modular pipeline and produces unchanged output
- Structured payload documented for future MQTT work without introducing new transport logic
- Tests from 2.1 pass reliably

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-29-command-pipeline-modularization/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.


## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.


## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `2-transport-adapter-preparation-implementation.md`.

Use the implementation report template provided in the Task Group 1 prompt. Ensure you document:
- Summary of adapter updates and documentation changes
- File paths for code modifications
- Tests created/updated in 2.1 and their focus areas
- Compliance with relevant standards files listed below

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

IMPORTANT: Ensure that your implementation work is ALIGNED and DOES NOT CONFLICT with the user's preferences and standards as detailed in the following files:
