# Implementation Report — Task 3: Test Gap Review & Regression Audit

## Summary
- Audited new coverage, added regression-focused tests for CID sequencing and batch aggregation, and reran the combined feature-specific suites to confirm parity.

## Changes Made
### Regression Tests
**Location:** `test/test_MotorControl/test_CommandPipeline.cpp`

- Added `test_batch_aggregates_estimate` to ensure multi-command batches emit a single aggregated `CTRL:ACK` with `est_ms`.
- Added `test_execute_cid_increments` to verify CID allocation remains monotonic across sequential structured calls.

**Rationale:** These paths were most susceptible to subtle regressions after introducing structured results and batch state handling.

## Database Changes (if applicable)

_None._

## Dependencies (if applicable)

_No new dependencies._

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `test/test_MotorControl/test_CommandPipeline.cpp` — regression tests for batch aggregation and CID sequencing.
- `test/test_MotorControl/test_main.cpp` — registered the additional regression tests.

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Added regression-specific cases without exceeding the 10-test limit.
- Integration tests: ✅ Re-ran `pio test -e native -f test_MotorControl` and `pio test -e native -f test_NetCommands`.
- Edge cases covered: aggregated estimates, CID reuse.

### Manual Testing Performed
- None.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### `@agent-os/standards/testing/unit-testing.md`
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
- Focused on high-risk behaviors only, kept the suite within prescribed bounds, and documented results.

**Deviations:** None.

## Integration Points (if applicable)

- Regression tests rely on the structured `execute` method introduced earlier and therefore validate the shared path used by all transports.

## Known Issues & Limitations

- NET async pathways still depend on runtime behavior (immediate prints); additional hardware-in-the-loop validation remains future work.

## Performance Considerations

- No runtime changes; additional tests run only in native environments.

## Security Considerations

- Not applicable.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

- All follow-on work (e.g., MQTT transport) can rely on the documented tests as guardrails.

## Notes

- White-listed builds after regression tests with `pio run -e esp32DedicatedStep --silent` to ensure firmware still compiles cleanly.
