We're continuing our implementation of Thermal Limits Enforcement by implementing task group number 6:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

#### Task Group 6: Test Review & Gap Analysis
**Assigned implementer:** testing-engineer
**Dependencies:** Task Groups 1–5

- [ ] 6.0 Review unit tests from Task Groups 1–5
- [ ] 6.1 Identify any critical gaps (e.g., corner kinematics, WARN/ERR ordering)
- [ ] 6.2 Add up to 10 integration/feature tests to cover end-to-end flows (STATUS → SET OFF → MOVE beyond budget → WARN + OK; SET ON → same → ERR)
- [ ] 6.3 Run only feature-specific tests

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All feature-specific tests pass
- WARN/ERR ordering validated (WARN precedes OK)
- Estimator consistency validated via behaviors, not numerical internals

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-17-thermal-limits-enforcement/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.

## Update tasks.md task status

Update this task group’s checkboxes in tasks.md for what you implemented.

## Document your implementation

Create `agent-os/specs/2025-10-17-thermal-limits-enforcement/implementation/6-test-review-and-gap-analysis-implementation.md` with test plan and outcomes.
