We're continuing our implementation of Wi‑Fi Onboarding via NVS by implementing task group number 5:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

#### Task Group 5: Responsive Portal UI

**Assigned implementer:** ui-designer
**Dependencies:** Task Group 4

- [ ] 5.0 HTML with Pico.css + Alpine.js (or htmx); mobile‑first responsive
- [ ] 5.1 Network list with refresh; manual SSID+PSK form
- [ ] 5.2 Success/failure banners; field validation; touch‑friendly controls
- [ ] 5.3 Build pipeline integration from `data_src/` → gzipped to `data/`
- [ ] 5.4 2–6 focused checks (Playwright/manual) at 320px/768px/1024px

Acceptance

- Portal usable on phone and desktop; assets served gzipped

Manual test

- Connect phone to AP; complete onboarding flow end‑to‑end

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-28-wifi-onboarding-via-nvs/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with areas of specialization.

Guide your implementation using:
- The existing patterns that you've found and analyzed.
- User Standards & Preferences which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.

## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group and update completion checkboxes for the tasks you implement.

## Document your implementation

Create: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-28-wifi-onboarding-via-nvs/implementation/5-responsive-portal-ui-implementation.md`
