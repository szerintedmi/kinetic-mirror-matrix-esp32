# Spec Verification Report — Wi‑Fi Onboarding via NVS (2025-10-28)

## Summary
- Spec path: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-28-wifi-onboarding-via-nvs`
- Files present: `planning/`, `implementation/`, `verification/`, `spec.md`, `tasks.md`
- Visuals: None found in `planning/visuals/`

## Checks

### Check 1: Requirements Accuracy (planning/requirements.md)
- User answers captured: Yes — boot fallback to SoftAP by timeout; SSID `SOFT_AP_SSID_PREFIX + last-3-bytes(MAC)`; password from `SOFT_AP_PASS`; scan + manual entry; no NVS encryption; 5s long‑press reset; LED + serial feedback; MAC‑derived ID; single network; WPS/TLS/captive‑DNS/mDNS out of scope.
- Follow-ups captured: Yes — 3‑byte suffix OK; secrets updated; LED pin to common ESP32 DevKit GPIO in `Esp32Dev.hpp`.
- Additional user requests captured:
  - Independent library with no coupling to motion control or serial parsing (Non‑Functional) — present.
  - `NET:SET,<ssid>,<pass>` command; suspend `NET:*` during connecting with `CTRL:ERR NET_BUSY_CONNECTING`; no `est_ms` — present.
  - `NET:STATUS` command — present.
  - LED patterns clarified (fast=AP, slow=connecting, solid=connected) — present.
- Reusability notes documented: Yes — LittleFS gzip pipeline (`tools/gzip_fs.py`), LittleFS config, `include/secrets.h`.

Result: ✅ Requirements accurately reflect user inputs.

### Check 2: Visual Assets
- Command run: `ls -la planning/visuals/` → No files.
- Requirements mention visuals: N/A.

Result: ✅ No visuals present; nothing to reconcile.

### Check 4: Requirements Deep Dive (coverage)
- Explicit features: SoftAP onboarding; STA fallback; NVS persistence; serial `NET:*`; LED feedback; long‑press reset — covered.
- Constraints: single network; plaintext NVS; Arduino core; gzip pipeline; responsive portal — covered.
- Out of scope: WPS/TLS/captive‑DNS/mDNS; multiple networks; static IP; NVS encryption/ESP‑IDF hybrid — excluded.
- Reusability: documented (no code exploration performed).
- Implicit: MAC‑derived device ID and SSID uniqueness tradeoff — addressed.

Result: ✅ Complete and aligned.

### Check 5: Core Specification Validation (spec.md)
- Goal and stories align with requirements — yes.
- Core requirements list only requested features — yes.
- Out of scope matches requirements — yes.
- Reusability mentions existing console/processor and gzip pipeline — yes.
- Non‑functional: responsive UI; motor timing isolation; library decoupling — included per requests.

Result: ✅ Spec aligns with requirements.

### Check 6: Task List Validation (tasks.md)
- Test limits respected:
  - Group 1: 2–4 native + 2–4 on‑device (≈4–8) ✅
  - Group 2: 2–6 ✅
  - Group 3: 2–4 ✅
  - Group 4: 2–6 ✅
  - Group 5: 2–6 ✅
  - Group 6/7: manual/E2E ✅
  - Approx total: 12–30 tests (within guidance of ~16–34 overall; acceptable).
- Reusability references in tasks: implied (gzip pipeline integration, LittleFS serving). Minor suggestion below to explicitly cite `tools/gzip_fs.py` in 4.0/5.3.
- Specificity/traceability: tasks map directly to requirements and spec sections — yes.
- Visual references: N/A (no visuals).
- Numbering/order: Sequential and matches execution order — yes.
- HELP acceptance: explicitly requires NET actions and syntax to be listed — yes.

Result: ✅ Tasks are implementable and test‑limited. Minor enhancement suggested.

## Issues
- Minor: Make reusability explicit in tasks by referencing `tools/gzip_fs.py` in Task 4.0 or Task 5.3 (currently implied by “Build pipeline integration”).

No critical issues found.

## Conclusion
Ready for implementation. The spec and tasks align with requirements, respect testing limits, and document reusability. Proceed to implementation per execution order.
