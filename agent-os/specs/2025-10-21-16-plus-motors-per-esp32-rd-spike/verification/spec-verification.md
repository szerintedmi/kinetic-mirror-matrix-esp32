# Specification Verification Report

## Verification Summary
- Overall Status: ✅ Passed
- Date: 2025-10-21
- Spec: 2025-10-21-16-plus-motors-per-esp32-rd-spike

## Inputs Reviewed
- Requirements: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-21-16-plus-motors-per-esp32-rd-spike/planning/requirements.md`
- Spec: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-21-16-plus-motors-per-esp32-rd-spike/spec.md`
- Tasks: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-21-16-plus-motors-per-esp32-rd-spike/tasks.md`
- Visuals folder: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-21-16-plus-motors-per-esp32-rd-spike/planning/visuals/` (none found)

## Check 1: Requirements Accuracy
- User decisions captured verbatim (SLEEP gating, own STEP gen, global SPEED/ACCEL, microsecond DIR guards, keep 74HC595, target 10 ksteps/s, no telemetry, protocol simplification, out-of-scope items).
- No missing or misrepresented answers observed.
- No follow-ups required; none present.
- Reusability: noted reuse of 74HC595 path implicitly; no explicit paths provided by user, reflected as “none identified”.

## Check 2: Visual Assets
- No visual assets found in `planning/visuals/`.
- Requirements correctly state no visuals provided.

## Check 4: Requirements Deep Dive
- Explicit features: shared STEP with SLEEP gating; hardware-timed pulse gen; global SPEED/ACCEL; microsecond DIR guards; protocol simplification; manual bench validation.
- Constraints: 10 ksteps/s target; jitter-free under future Wi‑Fi; reject SPEED/ACCEL changes during motion; unit tests for guard logic.
- Out of scope: microstepping; wireless features; PCB layout; telemetry (for spike).
- Reuse: keep 74HC595; no extra gating hardware unless blockers.
- Implicit needs: start/stop generator on demand; overlap rule at single global speed; latch timing avoiding STEP edges.

## Check 5: Core Specification Validation
- Goal aligns with scaling via shared STEP and protocol simplification.
- User stories match maker/dev outcomes.
- Core requirements mirror the requirements doc (SLEEP gating, global SPEED/ACCEL, DIR guards, jitter-free gen).
- Out-of-scope items correctly listed.
- Reusability mentions existing 74HC595 driver and controller modules.

## Check 6: Task List Detailed Validation
- Test writing limits:
  - TG1: 2–6 tests (✅)
  - TG2: 2–6 tests (✅)
  - TG3: 2–6 parser tests + CLI smoke (✅)
  - TG5: 2–4 CLI tests (✅)
  - TG6: 2–6 tests (✅)
  - TG7: consolidation up to ~6 more (✅, within overall guidance)
  - TG8: manual bench (N/A)
- Reusability references: tasks leverage 74HC595 and existing controller; no unnecessary new components introduced (✅)
- Specificity & traceability: each task maps to requirements (generator, guards, integration, protocol, accel, tests, bench) (✅)
- Scope: no tasks outside requirements (✅)
- Visual alignment: not applicable (no visuals) (✅)
- Task counts per group are within 3–10 items (✅)

## Check 7: Reusability and Over‑Engineering
- No unnecessary new components; reuse of 74HC595 and controller emphasized (✅)
- No duplicated logic identified (✅)
- New code is justified by shared‑STEP generator and protocol simplification (✅)

## Critical Issues
- None.

## Minor Issues
- Implementer role labels (e.g., “api-engineer”) don’t perfectly match firmware tasks but are constrained by available roles list. Non-blocking.

## Over‑Engineering Concerns
- None detected. Telemetry intentionally deferred per requirements.

## Recommendations
- Proceed to implementation following the execution order.
- During Group 7 bench work, capture simple CSV logs from CLI to aid manual comparisons.

## Conclusion
Ready for implementation. The spec, requirements, and tasks are aligned, test-limited, and incremental with CLI-verifiable steps.
