# Spec Verification — Command Pipeline Modularization

## Summary
- Requirements document accurately mirrors all user responses
- No visual assets present; requirements and spec correctly note absence
- Specification aligns with requirements and respects scope boundaries
- Tasks list follows limited testing approach and maintains feature traceability
- No reusability issues or over-engineering concerns identified

## Detailed Findings

### Check 1: Requirements Accuracy
- All eight Q&A items from research phase appear verbatim with matching answers
- No follow-up questions were logged; none expected
- Reusability section correctly records “No specific reuse targets provided” per user input
- Additional notes about limiting blast radius and preserving semantics are captured

### Check 2: Visual Assets
- `planning/visuals/` directory is empty (confirmed via `ls`); requirements and spec state “No visual assets provided”

### Check 3: Core Specification Validation
- Goal references replacing the monolithic processor and preserving behavior — matches requirements
- User stories reflect maintainer, test engineer, and future MQTT implementer perspectives derived from requirements
- Functional requirements cover context, parser, router, batch executor, structured result, and façade — all requested
- Non-functional requirements emphasize blast-radius minimization, performance parity, and limited injection, aligning with user guidance
- “Out of Scope” explicitly excludes MQTT implementation, behavior changes, and large DI frameworks, matching requirements
- Reusability notes correctly reference existing MotorCommandProcessor and related modules without inventing new reuse paths

### Check 4: Task List Validation
- Three task groups; all assigned to existing roles (api-engineer, testing-engineer)
- Test-writing limits observed:
  - Task Group 1 calls for 3-5 tests; only runs new tests + existing suites as needed
  - Task Group 2 calls for 2-4 tests; runs only those tests
  - Task Group 3 adds up to 6 additional tests and runs feature-specific sets only
- Tasks trace directly to spec requirements (context, parser/router, adapters, regression review)
- No tasks introduce off-scope features or unnecessary components
- No visual references needed because none exist

### Check 5: Reusability and Over-Engineering Assessment
- Spec and tasks reuse existing MotorController, net onboarding services, unit tests; no redundant components introduced
- Structured payload limited to current needs; no premature MQTT features
- Dependency injection restricted to required collaborators for testing as requested
- No evidence of over-engineering or missing reuse opportunities

## Issues & Recommendations
- No critical or minor issues detected
- No violations of testing limits or reusability expectations

## Conclusion
Specification package is ready for implementation. No revisions required.
