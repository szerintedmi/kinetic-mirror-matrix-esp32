# Task 7: End-to-end verification

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #7 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-28-wifi-onboarding-via-nvs/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** testing-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Document the full onboarding flow, ensure serial + portal paths remain consistent, capture manual verification steps, and publish README guidance (including LED patterns and long-press reset).

## Implementation Summary
Extended the project README with a dedicated Wi-Fi onboarding section covering SoftAP portal usage, serial fallbacks, LED patterns, long-press behavior, and filesystem upload commands. Compiled a manual verification checklist under `planning/verification/` so the lab session can record pass/fail evidence for SoftAP, serial fallback, reset recovery, and HTTP API smoke tests. Finally, ran the native test suite to confirm regressions weren’t introduced during the refactor.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
- `agent-os/specs/2025-10-28-wifi-onboarding-via-nvs/planning/verification/2025-10-28-wifi-onboarding-manual.md` – Manual verification scenarios A–D with status placeholders and detailed steps.

### Modified Files
- `README.md` – Added Wi-Fi onboarding instructions, LED status mapping, long-press reset notes, and filesystem build/upload steps.

## Key Implementation Details

### README onboarding guide
**Location:** `README.md`

Introduced a new “Wi-Fi Onboarding” section describing portal usage, serial command equivalents, LED feedback, long-press reset, and HTTP endpoint quick reference. Quickstart now includes `buildfs` / `uploadfs` commands so static assets are flashed alongside firmware.

**Rationale:** Provides a single authoritative reference for operators bringing devices online via either transport.

### Manual verification checklist
**Location:** `agent-os/specs/.../planning/verification/2025-10-28-wifi-onboarding-manual.md`

Outlines four scenarios (SoftAP portal flow, serial fallback, long-press reset, HTTP API curl checks) with explicit steps and logging expectations. Status boxes remain unchecked pending hardware execution.

**Rationale:** Ensures future test runs capture evidence in a consistent location per spec instructions.

## Database Changes (if applicable)

N/A.

## Dependencies (if applicable)

None.

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated

No new test files; leveraged existing suites.

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete — `pio test -e native`
- Integration tests: ❌ None (hardware-dependent)
- Edge cases covered: LED cadence, onboarding logic (see Tasks 3–4) validated within native suite.

### Manual Testing Performed
Hardware validation pending; checklist prepared for execution once devices are available.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Global Conventions
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** Centralized user-facing guidance in the README, ensuring documentation stays discoverable and current.

**Deviations (if any):** None.

### Build & Testing Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/testing/build-validation.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** Documented native test run (`pio test -e native`) as part of the closure for this spec.

**Deviations (if any):** None.

## Integration Points (if applicable)

- README references the new HTTP endpoints (Task 4) and portal assets (Task 5).
- Verification checklist references scenarios exercising Tasks 3–6.

## Known Issues & Limitations

- Manual verification still outstanding; results will be recorded once hardware testing occurs.

## Performance Considerations

N/A.

## Security Considerations

N/A.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

Task 7 ties together the artefacts produced in Tasks 3–6 and documents test execution for future reference.

## Notes

- Upload the LittleFS image (`pio run -e esp32dev -t uploadfs`) whenever portal assets change; README now calls this out explicitly.
