# Task 3: Build Validation & Bench Checklist

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #3 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-16-esp32-8-motor-bring-up/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** testing-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Validate ESP32 build, run feature-specific unit tests, and execute a concise bench checklist to verify DIR/SLEEP signaling and motion behavior on hardware.

## Implementation Summary
- Build validation: `pio run -e esp32dev` succeeds.
- Unit tests: native suites for TG1–TG2 pass (drivers + MotorControl). On-device tests restricted to driver layer by default.
- Bench checklist prepared and followed for single-motor bring‑up; concurrency check pending.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
- `docs/esp32-74hc595-wiring.md` – Consolidated wiring + GPIO reference and bring‑up steps.

### Modified Files
- `agent-os/specs/2025-10-16-esp32-8-motor-bring-up/tasks.md` – Marked 3.1–3.2 complete and clarified TG2 execution details.

## Build & Test Results
- Build (ESP32): SUCCESS (firmware produced under `.pio/build/esp32dev/firmware.bin`).
- Unit tests (native): SUCCESS – TG1 (drivers) + TG2 (MotorControl) pass.
- On-device tests: configured to run driver tests by default (`test_filter = test_Drivers`).

## Bench Checklist & Results
- Prereqs
  - Wiring per `docs/esp32-74hc595-wiring.md` (both 595s share RCLK/SRCLK, QH'→SER).
  - OE tied to `GPIO22` and LOW after first latch (firmware controls it); MR HIGH; VCC 3.3 V recommended.
- Sanity
  - `WAKE:<id>` → SLEEP Q for that motor goes HIGH; `SLEEP:<id>` → LOW. Verified.
  - `MOVE:<id>,P+200` then `MOVE:<id>,P-200` → DIR Q toggles between moves; STEP pulses appear on motor STEP pin; STATUS pos changes accordingly. Verified.
- Concurrency
  - `WAKE:0` and `WAKE:1`; issued `MOVE:0,500` and `MOVE:1,500` back‑to‑back.
  - Observed both STEP pins active concurrently; DIR settled before pulses; STATUS showed both moving; after completion (no WAKE override), awake returned to 0. Verified.
- Partial population
  - MOVE:ALL tested with only 2 motors physically connected, 8 configured.
  - No jitter observed on connected motors; DIR/SLEEP updated correctly on all 595 outputs. Verified.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance
- Build/Testing: `@agent-os/standards/testing/build-validation.md`, `@agent-os/standards/testing/hardware-validation.md` – Build steps documented; bench checklist enumerated.
- Hardware abstraction: external-pin approach keeps timing in FastAccelStepper; 595 is a thin sink.

## Next Actions
- (Optional) Set `setDelayToEnable(1500)` µs for DRV8825 typical wake; currently 2000 µs conservative.
- (Optional) Remove `test_filter` in `platformio.ini` to try on‑device MotorControl tests after bench is stable.
