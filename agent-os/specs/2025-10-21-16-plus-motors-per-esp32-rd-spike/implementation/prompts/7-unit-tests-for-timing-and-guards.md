We're continuing our implementation of 16+ Motors per ESP32 (Shared STEP Spike) by implementing task group number 7:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

#### Task Group 7: Unit Tests for Timing and Guards
**Assigned implementer:** testing-engineer
**Dependencies:** Task Groups 1-3, 6

- [ ] 6.0 Consolidate timing/guard tests
  - [ ] 6.1 Review tests from 1.1 and 2.1; add up to 6 more for edge cases
  - [ ] 6.2 Ensure host-native tests run under PlatformIO `env:native` if available

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-21-16-plus-motors-per-esp32-rd-spike/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written and ensuring those tests pass.

## Update tasks.md task status

Update this task group's checkboxes in `tasks.md` upon completion of sub-tasks you implemented.

## Document your implementation

Create: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-21-16-plus-motors-per-esp32-rd-spike/implementation/7-timing-guards-tests-implementation.md`

Structure: see template in implement-spec guide.
